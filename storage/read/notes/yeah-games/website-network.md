Have network of all yEAh Games sites like the archives, yible and repositories of html directories and files all with the same navbar at type, all hosted in same github pages setup, just using custom domain (either yeahgames.pro or yeahgames.net)

including random file directories like backedup discord etc, all in one place, all files should be moved to public directories for easy access in one place navbar custom domain etc

and chatbubble across the network for easy chatting, separte channels for each part of the network  (archives, yible, law, etc.)

Depreacated sites in dropdown menu, hover over to display a hover text or brackets, idk, showing "off-network sites", for old archives, old sites, neocities sites, and so on, off network (github), at end of menu, also add duplicate, and so on menup tions, 

export wordpress and change wordpress links to header website; with archives on github on navbar menu; old archives wordpress site in dropdown; maybe add notice to it

jekyll import wordpress --dbname yeaharchives --socket SOCKET --user USER --password PW --host HOST --port PORT --table_prefix PREFIX --site_prefix PREFIX --clean_entities --comments --categories --tags --more_excerpt --more_anchor --status STATUS,STATUS2



**ALWAYS MAKE CHANGES TO STANDARD THINGS ACROSS NETWORK (EG NAVBAR) ON MAIN DIRECTORY SITE!!!!!!!!**

update deprecated and social menus to include archives, change archive menu link to new archives

archives use library tempalate for setup, install navbar from main, etc.
get pages setup and more markdown stuff add directory and change all pages with navbar html etc

get chat done with actual chat and add template


on archives import to github desktop to add and reorganize all the archive files

**ARCHIVE GOAL:**
TWO SEPARTE "SITES" (maybe subdomain later? prob not)
ONE FOR LIBRARY (WHICH IS USER-END SITE FOR LINKING AND ACCESSING THE ARCHIVES; sorting and searching and display, along with sourced metadata for each one from og; just get set up old stuff for migration then start archiving more stuff) there will be categories, featured images, short descs, metadata, browsing through categories; while the archives is a back-end (still accessible) archive of everything that is only accessible through urls or the library or directory; the library is the way to access the archives and searches/displays the archives for you. on each archive category, there will be barely formatted directory stating that you're on a archive shelf/backend category and you can return to library or check out archived material in the sort method; library will be front-page access to the yg archives with search and browse and more; archives will stay simple markdown (to html) files for simplicity; possibly add header but undecided if only on library and make each archive file open in new tab for looking at; like taking out of archive\

when we're adding new markdown posts, we should write them on wordpress and export them to md so the header and everything works (unless it's a template post like the quotes)

do chat and make sure to add chat on all new webpages

still add general navbar somehow (custom css somehow or on same menu bar, i'm not sure) **probablyz good enough

also add chat to archives library **done

also still have to add discord export, might do folder at a time to help; make sure to do it in github desktop and sync all changes

add mobile navbar to archive library


CANCEL TEMPLATE SUBSCRIPTION

ADD NETWORK LOGIN FEATURE? (github pages, yeahgames account somehow)

docs.yeahgames.net for docs previously stored on archives (still accessible on docs on archives, but links to pages on the actual docs so still searchable ona rchives since archives archives everything yg related)

bots and code can be another subdomain

add merch to yeahgames.net (merch template with images (maybe models) and links to where to buy which are design links)

ADD YCHOOL.YEAHGAMES.NET and move over the interactive template to on a website /textbooks/yeath, MAKE A SCHOOL WEBSITE FOR LEARNING FIND ONLINE LEARNING TEMPLATE

add store.yeahgames.net using template found in store page of another templat,e link using shopping cart for merch and add on navbar (I think it's the second admin template)

docs.yeahgames.net for all docs including bot docs

change archives template to something including maybe news or other docs template, not sure, probably like a blog/news; library isn't great but could work

add admin menu on navbar too, get admin dashboard  with links to all subcategories on sidebar like the templates for easy access

news.yeahgames.net using news template

DOCS:
make subdomain (docs.yg) redirect to the /library/browse/docs page where we'll host all docs (convert md files imported and add others) and they will be browsable searchable at /library/browse/cat/docs where we'll add the docs template (docy) and browse there.

NEWS:
make subdomain (news.yg) redirect to the /library/browse/news page where it will sort posts for news from archives, and post links will link to /archive/sort/news/etc (will just use normal archive template)

LEGAL:
subdomain legal.yg just redirects to browsable library archives file for legal

library.yeahgames.net is now the accessible version of the file upload drive of archives.yeahgames.net where everyone can browse it without urls, and in newspaper format
actual stuff is hosted at archives.yeahgames.net

add admin to navbar (with login or lock button/icon)

Upload the rest of the archive files into the archives/sort to start working on library, also should upload pages like about from old archives

admin dashboard should link to the university admin template which will have links to templates as directories and more, graphs, links to cloudflare and google search console, registrars, subdomain lists and more

add navbar to everything inlcuding admin and shop 

ADD FINANCE DOCS ON ARCHIVE

Have yEAh Games username for claiming stuff:
yee - binh
torin - guyman147

docs will be hosted on archives, but will be embedded via iframe onto the browsable docs with the docy format on the library for both

maybe do embeds for all posts?

always leave directory file path on archives when posting announcement at bottom in code, like `/archive/sort/news/announcements/posts/etc`

add a notes file to the admin dashboard like this and have obsidian create a vault for yeah games notes inside the github folder to be able to transfer and access on github pages at admin.yg/notes or smth

new news posts can be created directly as an archive post instead of being added in the archive, but an archive post can either be added or embedded, still has to be in both

introducing yeahgames.net can be the featured post big on whatever template we choose for the archives and link to announcement, maybe part of the yolidays event?

add iframe embed into library for all posts directly to the archive posts for easier access, archives is hosting domain library can access and view them

docs will still have a post image but will display the iframe embed there and on docs

notes hosted at admin will be iframe embedded into the dashboard, maybe an editing fucntion (no

add chat to all new pages + navbar

maybe unigon.net homepage dashboard template for yeahgames.net, each sidebar link could be subdomains and dashboard, etc. **NEVER  MIND; USE A JEKYLL TEMPLATE**

docs are a collection by the archives (add in library menu: collections > docs) where some archive files are aggregated in a different format for diff  use, just embedded onto there.

library website change domains so archives.yg becomes library.yg and the chirpy theme is the library for browsing the archives, while library/collections hosts different aggregators of archives content via embedding the chirpy posts. library using chirpy as it is will run all posts and act as the main aggregator of yg library content, entrance into the archives by displaying everything

collections.yeahgames.net/library or something to host collection pages like docs

we will still have archives.yeahgames.net, but it hosts static files that aren't displayed in the library archives but are still either linked or embedded, like the discord exports

library-collections.yg.net but collections.yg just redirects for easier use

INSTEAD OF HTML DOCS TEMPLATE FOR DOCS COLLECTION, GET A jekyll site (maybe a whole new subdomain, e.g. docs-library-collections.yg.net) or something

always add a copy of new markdown posts to the library to the archives-cdn as well, just so they can continue to be accessed; but library takes update priority, just copy and paste a copy of the markdown file and post it quickly when done

on library-collections, index will be a template directory linking to all public collections

find a jekyll directory template for the yeahgames.net homepage to direct to all subdomains and pages, etc.

create readme.md on yeahgames profile with directory and yg image banner with directory to all subdomains and short descriptions, along with archives team goal and current projects, code links, etc.

add discord post on library with embed **and** links

add the yeah games github readme as more docs to the docs file

how-to guide to beomoming archivist, moderator, github proejct contributor on docs

docs will gave guides about how to edit certain things, like markdown syntax and mardown syntax for varoius templates, like the chirpy and docs, instructions for w3css and how to edit the standard navbar and yible (always file navbar changes on yeahgames.net and write it down somewhere; notes, issues, etc.)

docs: how to submit quotes, file a yourt case, etc. from around the server

add notice on docs posts on main library collection that they are being hosted and embedded/displayed from the "Docs" library collection and you are viewing an embedded version, we recommend visiting the docs page in order to view them properly and to learn more, etc.

add melontime docs category; includes chrome dino and bypassing restrictions text (in hosting server)

maybe different collections can host each category, eg. quotes? it might be a good idea for organization, standardization, and people can view what they want without news clutter, etc., while library just aggregates all content embedded? possible idea.

for example quotes, news, etc. all have their quotes-collections domain but everything is embedded into the library except for some stuff, like embedded discord archives-cdn stuff maybe

create ads.yeahgames.net for uploading, creating and instructions for ads, also mainly for redirect tracking when someone clicks on an ad (ads.yeahgames.net/click/adlocationonnetwrok/ad_id) or something

message on library for other collections:

Hey! Reminder that you're on the yEAh Games main library and are viewing an item in our catalog in an external collection via an embed. The yEAh Games main libary's purpose is to provide a medium for regular users to be able to browse through all the Archives in one place; but in reality, most of our content catalog is hosted on external Library collections and are simply embedded onto the main browsable Library. If you're interested on more detail or if something isn't working as intended, we recommend you visit the external collection's page at: docs-collections.yeahgames.net/page

if deprecated external collection or page, add warning, discord exports need warning for potentially nsfw content on the discord server when browsing

download a cms editor from github (bookmarked on firefox) and set it up for all jekyll yeah games websites, and add documentation pages copied from the github repo on to the docs for people to set it up and navigate to localhost:4000

add permenant ad offer from discord to the ad docs page, as we're keeping it like that for an indefinite period of time

set up ads.yeahgames.net/book to redirect to form and the ads dashboard home screen, etc.

gallery portfolio view for quotes theme, so you can see them all via an image or placeholder

library-collections directory can be like a catalog blog or the library theme with books for each colelction

always make sure to add docs for each new theme to the yeah games docs, including the quotes gridster theme (https://ickc.github.io/gridster-jekyll-theme/)

add collections dropdown to navbar with each collection (quotes, news, docs, etc.)

make separate okdex site for browsing through okdex pokemon, etc., linked in rules docs

add collections to sidebar of the main library, maybe title for collections, but use redirect pages that link to the site

remove redirect from archives-cdn to library since it is now an official collection, or maybe not (decide)

add navbar to library creating new includes html file with improts?

try chat again on archives including elsewhere, maybe won't include it although we could try an iframe

start adding images to archives cdn, not view, but /assets or **/cdn** and host images off of there from now on for security and safety, all assets should be stored on archives-cdn, so when you oepn the link is like that and we have them all safe, add docs page about storing files on the archvies to view, by using archives cdn not any external or on your site, for images and other files (e.g., discord exports)

change pub dates for all qotds to the day they were actually published
